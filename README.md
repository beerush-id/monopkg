# Welcome to MonoPKG

**MonoPKG** is an interactive CLI tool for managing monorepos effortlessly. It offers a suite of commands to handle
`workspaces`, `packages`, `dependencies`, `scripts`, and `package versions` within a monorepo, making your development
process smoother and more efficient. If you enjoy doing everything manually, skip it! It's not for you. 😅

> **`MonoPKG`** isn't here to dethrone `turbo`, `nx`, `lerna`, or any other monorepo giants. It's your friendly
> neighborhood tool designed to make package management in a monorepo a breeze. So, no need for epic showdowns or
> comparisons. Just enjoy the simplicity! 🍺
