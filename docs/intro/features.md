## ü•∑ Simplified Workflow

MonoPKG simplifies the management of monorepos by providing a set of commands to manage packages, dependencies, scripts,
and more.

## ‚ö° Seamless Integration

Integrate MonoPKG with your existing monorepo setup to enhance your workflow and streamline your development process.

## Dependency Management

Manage dependencies across all your packages with a single command. No more repetitive installations.

::: info FYI
Working with small monorepos is easy, but as your project grows, managing dependencies can become a nightmare. MonoPKG
simplifies this process, allowing you to focus on development.

## Package Management

Create new packages from templates within your monorepo with ease. Save time and effort on manual setups.

![Package Management](/package.jpg)

::: info FYI
Creating new packages manually is fine. But, I bet you'd rather spend your time coding than setting up new packages.
MonoPKG helps you get started quickly.

## Script Management

Easily add, update, and run scripts across all packages with simple commands. Ensure consistency and save time.

::: info WHAT IF

You discovered a shiny new tool and want to update scripts in all packages? MonoPKG to the rescue! With a simple
command, you can sprinkle that script magic across your entire monorepo.

::: tip Example

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rimraf dist && tsup && publint",
    "clean": "rimraf dist"
  }
}
```

You want to add `format` script to all packages and change the `build` script to include the `format` script.

```sh
monopkg script add format="prettier --write ." -w packages
monopkg script add build="bun run format && rimraf dist && tsup && publint" -w packages
```

The above command adds a `format` script and update the `build` script to all packages under the `packages` folder. It's
that simple! ü™Ñ

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "bun run format && rimraf dist && tsup && publint",    // [!code ++]
    "clean": "rimraf dist",
    "format": "prettier --write ."    // [!code ++]
  }
}
```

## Catalog Management

Manage package versions centrally with catalogs. Define versions once and reference them across all your packages, ensuring consistency and simplifying updates.

::: warning
The catalog feature is only supported on **Bun v1.3.0 or higher**. Other package managers do not currently support this feature.
:::

![Catalog Management](/overview.jpg)

::: info CENTRALIZE YOUR VERSIONS

Instead of managing versions in each package.json, define them once in catalogs and reference them everywhere:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "catalog:",
    "lodash": "catalog:frontend"
  }
}
```

When you need to update a package version, you only need to change it in the catalog, not in every package.

::: tip Example

```sh
monopkg catalog add react@18.2.0 --global
monopkg catalog add lodash@4.17.21 -c frontend
monopkg catalog use react lodash -s
```

The above commands add packages to catalogs and then use those versions in your packages. Updating is as simple as changing the catalog entry.
