# Welcome to MonoPKG

**MonoPKG** is your go-to CLI tool for managing monorepos effortlessly. It offers a suite of commands to handle
dependencies, scripts, and package versions within a monorepo, making your development process smoother and more
efficient. If you enjoy doing everything manually, skip it! It's not for you. üòÖ

::: tip Just Don't!
**`MonoPKG`** isn't here to dethrone `turbo`, `nx`, `lerna`, or any other monorepo giants. It's your friendly
neighborhood tool designed to make package management in a monorepo a breeze. So, no need for epic showdowns or
comparisons. Just enjoy the simplicity! üç∫
:::

## Why Use MonoPKG?

Imagine you have the following monorepo structure:

::: details Your Awesome Monorepo

```plaintext
‚îú‚îÄ apps
|  ‚îú‚îÄ app-a
|  ‚îú‚îÄ app-b
‚îú‚îÄ packages
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-a
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-b
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-c
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-d
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-e
‚îú‚îÄ tools
|  ‚îú‚îÄ tool-a
|  ‚îú‚îÄ tool-b
‚îî‚îÄ package.json
```

### Adding Dependencies

Traditionally, adding a new dependency like `lodash` to all packages would require running multiple commands:

::: details Multi Command Madness

```sh
cd ./apps/app-a && bun add lodash
cd ../app-b && bun add lodash
cd ../../packages/pkg-a && bun add lodash
cd ../packages/pkg-b && bun add lodash
cd ../packages/pkg-c && bun add lodash
cd ../packages/pkg-d && bun add lodash
cd ../packages/pkg-e && bun add lodash
cd ../../tools/tool-a && bun add lodash
cd ../tools/tool-b && bun add lodash
```

:::

This process is not only tedious but also prone to errors. With MonoPKG, you can simplify this to a single command:

::: code-group

```sh [Global]
monopkg add lodash
```

```sh [Bun]
bun x @beerush/monopkg add lodash
```

```sh [NPM]
npx @beerush/monopkg add lodash
```

```sh [Yarn]
yarn x @beerush/monopkg add lodash
```

:::

::: info FYI

Unlike the built-in tools such as `turbo --filter`, MonoPKG uses the folder name to filter the packages instead of the
package name. This approach simplifies the process since you don't have to remember the package names, and you can see
the folder name right in your editor.

::: details Example

```sh
monopkg run clean -F app-a app-b
```

The above command runs `clean` command on `app-a` and `app-b` packages. With built-in tools, you would have to
use the package name instead of the folder name.

```sh
turbo run clean --filter "@scope/app-a"
```

:::

### Adding Scripts

Adding new scripts to each package manually can be a daunting task. MonoPKG makes it easy to add identical scripts
across all packages with minimal effort.

::: info
Avoid the hassle of editing each `package.json` file manually. Use MonoPKG to add scripts efficiently.

::: details Don't Look! ü•∑

```sh
monopkg add-script dev="tsup --watch" build="rimraf dist && tsup" -R packages
```

The above command is equivalent to going through each package under `packages` folder and adding the script manually.
It's a ninja move! ü•∑

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsup --watch",    // [!code ++]
    "build": "rimraf dist && tsup"    // [!code ++]
  }
}
```

### Linking Internal Packages

Linking internal packages manually involves editing the `dependencies` field in the `package.json` file of the target
package and run the `install` command. MonoPKG streamlines this process, reducing the risk of errors.

::: details Example

> [!INFO] Command
> ```sh [command]
> monopkg use -S pkg-a pkg-b -F pkg-c pkg-d
> ```
> The above command links `pkg-a` and `pkg-b` to `pkg-c` and `pkg-d`, and add them to the `dependencies` field in
> `package.json`. It's like magic! ü™Ñ

::: info Output

::: code-group

```json [pkg-c/package.json]
{
  "dependencies": {
    "some": "^1.0.0",
    "deps": "^1.0.0",
    "@beerush/pkg-a": "workspace:*",  // [!code ++]
    "@beerush/pkg-b": "workspace:*"   // [!code ++]
  }
}
```

```json [pkg-d/package.json]
{
  "dependencies": {
    "some": "^1.0.0",
    "deps": "^1.0.0",
    "@beerush/pkg-a": "workspace:*",  // [!code ++]
    "@beerush/pkg-b": "workspace:*"   // [!code ++]
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### Unified Dependency Management

Manage dependencies across all your packages with a single command. No more repetitive installations.

::: info FYI
Working with small monorepos is easy, but as your project grows, managing dependencies can become a nightmare. MonoPKG
simplifies this process, allowing you to focus on development.

### Consistent Scripts

Easily add and update scripts across all packages to ensure consistency and save time.

::: info WHAT IF

You discovered a shiny new tool and want to update scripts in all packages? MonoPKG to the rescue! With a simple
command, you can sprinkle that script magic across your entire monorepo.

::: tip Example

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rimraf dist && tsup && publint",
    "clean": "rimraf dist"
  }
}
```

You want to add `format` script to all packages and change the `build` script to include the `format` script.

```sh
monopkg add-script format "prettier --write ." -R packages
monopkg add-script build "bun run format && rimraf dist && tsup && publint" -R packages
```

The above command adds a `format` script and update the `build` script to all packages under the `packages` folder. It's
that simple! ü™Ñ

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "bun run format && rimraf dist && tsup && publint", // [!code ++]
    "clean": "rimraf dist",
    "format": "prettier --write ." // [!code ++]
  }
}
```
