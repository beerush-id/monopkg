# Welcome to MonoPKG

**MonoPKG** is your go-to CLI tool for managing monorepos effortlessly. It offers a suite of commands to handle dependencies, scripts, and package versions within a monorepo, making your development process smoother and more efficient. If you enjoy doing everything manually, skip it! It's not for you. üòÖ

::: tip Just Don't!
**`MonoPKG`** isn't here to dethrone `turbo`, `nx`, `lerna`, or any other monorepo giants. It's your friendly neighborhood tool designed to make package management in a monorepo a breeze. So, no need for epic showdowns or comparisons. Just enjoy the simplicity! üç∫
:::

## Why Use MonoPKG?

Imagine you have the following monorepo structure:

::: info root

```plaintext
‚îú‚îÄ apps
|  ‚îú‚îÄ app-a
|  ‚îú‚îÄ app-b
‚îú‚îÄ packages
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-a
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-b
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-c
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-d
|  ‚îú‚îÄ pkg-e
‚îú‚îÄ tools
|  ‚îú‚îÄ tool-a
|  ‚îú‚îÄ tool-b
‚îî‚îÄ package.json
```

:::

### Adding Dependencies

Traditionally, adding a new dependency like `lodash` to all packages would require running multiple commands:

::: info Manual

```sh
cd ./apps/app-a && bun add lodash
cd ../app-b && bun add lodash
cd ../../packages/pkg-a && bun add lodash
cd ../packages/pkg-b && bun add lodash
cd ../packages/pkg-c && bun add lodash
cd ../packages/pkg-d && bun add lodash
cd ../packages/pkg-e && bun add lodash
cd ../../tools/tool-a && bun add lodash
cd ../tools/tool-b && bun add lodash
```

:::

This process is not only tedious but also prone to errors. With MonoPKG, you can simplify this to a single command:

::: code-group

```sh [Global]
monopkg add lodash
```

```sh [Bun]
bun x @beerush/monopkg add lodash
```

```sh [NPM]
npx @beerush/monopkg add lodash
```

```sh [Yarn]
yarn x @beerush/monopkg add lodash
```

:::

### Adding Scripts

Adding new scripts to each package manually can be a daunting task. MonoPKG makes it easy to add identical scripts across all packages with minimal effort.

::: tip
Avoid the hassle of editing each `package.json` file manually. Use MonoPKG to add scripts efficiently.
:::

::: details Don't Look! ü•∑

::: code-group

```sh [Global]
monopkg add-script build "rimraf dist && tsup && publint" -r packages
```

```sh [Bun]
bun x @beerush/monopkg add-script build "rimraf dist && tsup && publint" -r packages
```

```sh [NPM]
npx @beerush/monopkg add-script build "rimraf dist && tsup && publint" -r packages
```

```sh [Yarn]
yarn x @beerush/monopkg add-script build "rimraf dist && tsup && publint" -r packages
```

The above command is equivalent to going through each package and adding the script manually. It's a ninja move! ü•∑

### Linking Internal Packages

Linking internal packages manually involves editing the `dependencies` field in the `package.json` file of the target package and running `bun install` or `npm install`. MonoPKG streamlines this process, reducing the risk of errors.

::: tip
Simplify the process of linking internal packages with MonoPKG and keep your monorepo organized.
